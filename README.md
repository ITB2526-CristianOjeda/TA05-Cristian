# Galactic Portfolio: Galaxia Aurora & StellarPulse

A Star Wars-inspired landing page and portfolio dashboard designed to showcase interactive astronomy projects. This interface combines thematic visual effects (such as lightspeed jumps and Jedi iconography) with educational content about space exploration and signal analysis.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

This portal serves as the entry point for two main interactive applications developed by the authors:

### 1. Galaxia Aurora
**Galaxia Aurora** is a 3D galactic map that blends real astronomical data with imagined worlds.
* **Exploration:** Users can travel through the galaxy to explore star systems, nebulae, and fictional planets.
* **Educational:** Provides detailed information on cosmic phenomena.
* **Origins:** Born as an experiment inspired by James Webb Space Telescope imagery, it now features over 40 star systems.

### 2. StellarPulse
**StellarPulse** is a deep space signal simulator designed for analyzing waves and patterns from distant galaxies.
* **Simulation:** Allows users to investigate anomalies and act as astrophysicists.
* **Features:** Includes visual graphs, soundscapes, and historical signal logs (inspired by Fast Radio Bursts/FRBs).
* **Goal:** To make astrophysics accessible and fun through creative simulation.
